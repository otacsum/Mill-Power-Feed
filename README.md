# Mill-Power-Feed
Arduino code, Logic Diagrams, and other assets for an X-axis Power Feed for my Milling Machine.

The v1.0.0 release is the one and only final release I will be making.  I no longer own this machine, and the power feed software seems to be in a stable state.
Any future changes to the LCD, rotary encoder, stepper drivers, or switches may need configuration or tuning.  Additionally, future updates to peripheral libraries may require updates.

User configuration parameters can be found in [`include/configuration.h`](include/configuration.h).

As stated in the [License](/docs/LICENSE) this software is provided as-is, without warranty of any kind.

### TODOs that never got done:
- Schematics
- BOM
- Embed 3rd party libraries
- Break up Classes into dedicated files
