# Mill-Power-Feed
Arduino code, Circuit Diagrams, and other assets for an X-axis Power Feed for my Milling Machine.  

*NOTE:* This project is a work-in-progress.  I generally try to keep the ```main``` branch in a working state, but it may be sub-optimal or entirely broken at any time.  

User configuration parameters can be found in ```src/configuration.h```

### TODO:
- Schematics
- BOM
- Embed 3rd party libraries
- Break up Classes into dedicated files
- More...
